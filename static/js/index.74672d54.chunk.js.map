And example of a scale 1/8\" = 1'; this means that 1/8 inches on the drawing will correspond to 1 feet \n// in real life. The dimensions could be in the metric system (m^2 and lm) or imperial system (Sqft and lf).\n\n// 2) Draw Polygon: I will need to draw polygons inside Miro boards. The number of pixels cover by the polygon, based on the input \n// scale, will result in the area of the polygon in SquareFeet or SquareMeters. I will be great if I will be able to draw rectangles \n// too, which a special type of polygons.\n\n// 3) Draw line: I will need to draw line segments inside Miro boards. The number of pixels cover by the line, based on the input \n// scale, will result in the length of the line in Feet or Meters.\n\n// 4) Count Shapes: I will need to count certain objects on architectural drawings. We can achieve that by clicking shapes on top \n// of the concerned object and the count those shapes. No scale or dimension is needed for the shapes... only their count.\n\n// 5) Report: I will need to be able to extract the information created using the web plug-in that will be built, into excel. The \n// idea is to compile all the information of every polygon, line, or count done on the Miro board and create a report that provides structured information.\n\n// Note: All polygons, lines, and count will have specific properties that will be needed to be attached to each of them. Some of \n// these properties area: Name - Area - Type - Floor - Perimeter - Length - Count. As discussed on our call, these properties can \n// be input using a new UI inside Miro (example was the menu that appears on the left of the screen when selecting an object)\n\n\n// Select Scale Input (The scale is only used to calculate areas, perimeter, etc, or it should be used when the user zooms in/out? Zoom could not be done)\n// "],"sourceRoot":""}
